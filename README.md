# MyReads Project

This is the completed project for the final assessment project for Udacity's React Fundamentals course. The goal of this project was to add interactivity to the provided template app by refactoring the static code in the template. The application is designed to allow for searching a set of books so that found books can be added to one of several bookshelves, one each for "Currently Reading", "Wants to Read", and "Read". The books can be moved between bookshelves and also removed entirely from all bookshelves, so that the only place the removed books show up is in the search results.


## To Start the Project

To the project, just follow these simple steps:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`


## Important

The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.

## Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). You can find more information on how to perform common tasks [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).
